This is a PoC "desktop pet" Ã  la [shimeji][1] using [ebitengine][2], and should
run on Windows/Linux/Mac. It currently has only 3 animations: idle (default),
left-click dragging, and right-click.

Fair warning: I'm a Go noob who mostly has no idea what he's doing.
Read the source code at your own peril.
