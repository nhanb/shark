# What

This is a PoC "desktop pet" Ã  la [shimeji][1] using [ebitengine][2] that runs
on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It currently has only 3 animations: idle
(default), left-click dragging, and right-click.

Here's a demo video:

Fair warning: I'm a Go noob who mostly has no idea what he's doing.
Read the source code at your own peril.

# Download

[Download latest version][5] from GitHub Releases.

Newer builds straight from master branch are also available as artifacts on
GitHub and sourcehut:

[![github status](https://github.com/nhanb/shark/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)][gh]
[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~nhanb/shark/commits/master.svg)][srht]

GitHub requires logging in to download artifacts, while Sourcehut doesn't have
macOS builds. Such is life.

# Usage

Simply run the provided binary for your OS. Mac & Linux users may need to first
make the file executable with `chmod +x <file-name>`.

If run from a terminal, use the `-h` argument to see available options.
Currently there's only a `-size` argument which changes how big your shark will
be rendered. Windows users can create a shortcut which lets you specify your
desired arguments.

# Compile from source

- Follow [ebitengine's install guide][6]
- Run: `go build -tags ebitensinglethread -o dist/`
- Your compiled binary should now be in `./dist/`

Apparently it should compile on FreeBSD too but I haven't tried that.
Do let me know if it works on your FreeBSD desktop!
