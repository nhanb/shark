This is a PoC "desktop pet" Ã  la [shimeji][1] using [ebitengine][2] that runs
on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It currently has only 3 animations: idle
(default), left-click dragging, and right-click.

Fair warning: I'm a Go noob who mostly has no idea what he's doing.
Read the source code at your own peril.

# Download

Official tagged releases are available on [GitHub Releases][5].

Newer builds straight from master branch are also available as artifacts on
GitHub and sourcehut:
